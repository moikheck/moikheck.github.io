            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>My first review, and I'm giving to a book I hold dear.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><em>Renegades</em> by Marissa Meyer is a lot of things. It has action, sci-fi, some fantastical elements, betrayal, love, trust, plot twists, and a backbone to go through with it all. It's by far not a perfect book (or series, we'll touch on the other books later), but it has a lot of concepts that I adore and has become one of the major inspirations for an undisclosed book I've been working on since 2019. The first in its series, <em>Renegades</em> holds up for itself very well.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><b>Summary:</b></p>
            <p>Nova is a prodigy, essentially meaning she has superpowers. Not everyone does, which used to be a major point of persecution for prodigies, but after Ace Anarchy upended the world and tipped the power balance, two factions have fought to stake control of the city of Gatlon: the Anarchists and the Renegades. When Nova was young, her family was killed by a gang during the Age of Anarchy. From there, the Anarchists picked her up and raised her, cementing the idea that her family could have been saved if the "heroes," the Renegades, had been there to help.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>It became her goal to take them down alongside the other Anarchists, a quirky crew of characters with their own issues and vendettas, which was interrupted through one of their self-serving parades. When that plan goes awry, they determine the next best step is to enlist Nova in the Renegades herself as a double agent, seeking to find weak points and tear it all down.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Add to this a love interest in the Renegades factions, a rogue prodigy who doesn't seem to play by the rules, and a number of moral quanderings, and <em>Renegades</em> gives itself the justification of the roughly 550 pages of content.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>It's fun, excitment, adventure, and maybe a couple of plot twists you can see coming but are still glad to see.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><b>Readability: 5/5 ⭐</b></p>
            <p>We immediately start the story with the intense scene of the day Nova's life turned upside down, and the story rarely backs off from keeping us enthralled. Meyer keeps a strong central ground between describing the scene, acting out the scene, and keeping things at the exact temperature they should be at. Every time I pick up the story, I have it finished within a week, often at three in the morning. </p>
            <br/>
            <p><b>Characters: 4/5 ⭐</b></p>
            <p>With as diverse a cast as displayed in the story, it can be hard to keep everyone interesting in some way or another. Some characters, even in the direct groups and factions that Nova interacts with on a daily basis, are sidelined and flat. But the characters that do have depth are engaging and entertaining, and really pick it up where the others dropped it. Many have stereotypical issues and motivations (some of which are only revealed in later books), but they help to explain that character, rather than feeling like a hastily added trait that fits the moment.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><b>Enjoyment: 5/5 ⭐</b></p>
            <p>If you're a fan of superheroes, you'll love the take on a superpowered world Meyer gives, even if you've hit the blockbuster burnout that so many of us have felt post-Endgame. I rarely lost interest in what was happening in the story, or felt that I had to skip sections of paragraphs because things weren't moving. This is by far a serious achievement for my spasmatic brain.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><b>Concept: 4/5 ⭐</b></p>
            <p>For the time, this was a bit more significant in terms of concept. Now that we've had almost fifteen years of consistent Marvel/DC movies, the concept of "good versus bad but with superpowers and also maybe things aren't totally black and white" has been done again and again, and while it doesn't necessarily bring anything new to the table in that regard, the points of view and development around that concept is what drives this to have a four out of five.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><b>Pacing: 5/5 ⭐</b></p>
            <p>There isn't a lot to say here other than it keeps a consistent pacing. There are moments where things feel too fast or too slow, but that's bound to happen in any story.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><b>Plot: 5/5 ⭐</b></p>
            <p>The plot has a lot going on, but it never fails to keep things tied close together. An interaction two chapters ago stays important despite being part of a different thread of the story altogether, and there wasn't a time where I felt lost in what was happening. It handles some topics well, and while there are plenty of clichés or expected outcomes, at the end of the day, it never feels too blatant.</p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
            <p><em>Renegades</em> was one of the first books I'd ever purchased for myself from a Barnes & Noble, and I'd picked up a signed copy not long after it'd released. It has some really great craftsmanship that carries through to the second and third book, making sure to see almost every thread resolved. I would absolutely recommend this if you're looking for some good entertainment or are a fan of the superhero genre. It's written like it's meant for middle school or high school students (the age I was when it released), but I still find joy in reading it years later.</p>
