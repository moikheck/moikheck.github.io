            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p><em>Burn</em> is a very weird story.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>This, of course, isn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, I thought there were many things that were "weird" but were executed very well. The simple concept of dragons in the post-WWII era of the United States was alluring, and the characters were captivating to the very end. What keeps this book from going to a four or above, however, are the places it falls short.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><b>Summary:</b></p>
            <p>Sarah Dewhurst lives on a farm with her dad in Washington state, where they hire a dragon to help tend to the field. The dragon, Kazimir, seems to be following the trail of a dragon prophecy which centers around Sarah. The other characters, like Malcolm, who is part of a dragon-worshipping cult, his love interest, and a duo of FBI agents that are tailing them, bring interesting viewpoints to the events leading up to the "end of the world." Along with some plot twists, commentary on our own world, and the power to transfomr oneself, the story shapes up to be action-packed and easy to enjoy.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>That said, there are some serious things to consider when looking through the story, particularly in part two.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><b>Readability: 4/5 ⭐</b></p>
            <p>For the most part, the book is easy to pick up and read whenever you're able. Despite being a sci-fi/fantasy story, Ness doesn't waste your time with terms, phrases, events, and characters that are there just to pad the word count. Everyone and everything has a purpose, and he makes it easy to follow, even with the plot twists towards the final few chapters of the book. Where I take a star away is for the odd focus on certain aspects of things and not others. I suppose it can be hard to find a balance between character development and the process of dealing with dragon eggs, but it seemed some smoothness was sacrificed to have more "awesome" scenes.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><b>Characters: 4/5 ⭐</b></p>
            <p>I have almost no issue with the characters. They are unique and stand out against one another, and provide for an engrossing experience. My biggest qualm is that many of the "stars" lacked a significant arc in the story, other than to fall victim to the plot.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><b>Enjoyment: 5/5 ⭐</b></p>
            <p>Action, dragons, war, apocalyptic prophecy, and the devastating destruction of an entire city. It would be hard to mess this up if you're a fan of this sort of thing, and mess this up he did not. It's whimsical and captivating enough that you can almost suspend your disbelief.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><b>Concept: 4/5 ⭐</b></p>
            <p>Almost. If not for a few hiccups along the way (I'm looking at you, oversignified focus on the dragon eggs in the last quarter of the story), as well as a sometimes half-hearted dedication to the rules set in this universe, I would give this five stars.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><b>Pacing: 2/5 ⭐</b></p>
            <p>The two parts of the story have almost a jarringly different pacing. While that's a fair way to signify that pacing is going to change, action and events happening at double speed during the second part was a strange feeling after the coasting that felt like the first part. Add to this the sometimes drastic in-chapter changes to pace, and it started to become an inconsistent relay race. Obviously, books are going to have changes in pace--Things can't stay all slow or all action, after all--but the last few chapters seemed like a constant anxious build that inevitably left no payoff.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><b>Plot: 3/5 ⭐</b></p>
            <p>Which brings us to the plot to begin with. While there are things you can chalk up to people being people and dragons being dragons, the main plot seemed unnecessary sidelined for long portions of the first part of the story, and left on a quasi-cliffhanger at the end, implying a pickup at book two. However, the up until the very last moments, almost everything had seemed resolved. The setup for the second book felt less natural and more like he wanted an excuse to explore this reality, but couldn't find a better way to do it. Otherwise, I have no real issues with the plot. It stays grounded throughout, and there weren't many aspects that really stood out as red flags or things that seemed forced.</p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
            <p>Ultimately, I'm unsure if I would recommend <em>Burn</em> to someone unless they had some time to burn (haha, very funny) and nothing else on their list. It's not bad, but it's also not ground-shaking. I enjoyed the story, but it's not one I'm likely to pick up and reread a year or two from now.</p>
